### Embedding:
An embedding is a numerical vector (array of numbers) that represents text, images, or other data in a way that captures meaning, similarity, and relationships.

Below is a **detailed, descriptive explanation** (no tables) that covers **which models support which embedding dimensions** and **what is required to build a video/image chatbot with streaming using embeddings**, written in a research- and architecture-friendly way.


## 1. Embedding Models and Their Supported Dimensions (Detailed Explanation)

### Text Embedding Models

Modern LLM ecosystems provide dedicated **text embedding models** that convert text into dense numerical vectors.

OpenAI’s commonly used embedding model `text-embedding-ada-002` produces embeddings with **1536 dimensions**. This dimension size is a balance between semantic richness and computational efficiency and is widely used for semantic search, recommendation systems, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Newer OpenAI models such as `text-embedding-3-small` and `text-embedding-3-large` introduce **flexibility in embedding size**. While their default output dimensions are **1536** and **3072** respectively, these models allow developers to **request lower-dimensional embeddings** (for example 256, 512, or 1024 dimensions). This helps reduce storage and search costs while still preserving semantic meaning.

Lower dimensions are typically used when:

* Speed and cost matter more than precision
* Large-scale vector databases are involved
* Approximate similarity is acceptable

Higher dimensions are preferred when:

* High semantic accuracy is critical
* Long, complex documents are embedded
* Cross-domain similarity is needed


### Multimodal Embedding Models (Text + Image + Video)

Multimodal embeddings map **text, images, and videos into the same vector space**, enabling cross-modal similarity such as searching images using text or retrieving video scenes using a natural language query.

Google Vertex AI provides multimodal embedding models that generate vectors of around **1400 dimensions**. These embeddings are trained so that an image of a “dog,” a video clip of a dog, and the text “a dog running” appear close together in vector space.

Amazon Titan Multimodal Embeddings generate vectors of roughly **1024 dimensions**. These are designed for large-scale indexing of images and video streams and are optimized for enterprise workloads such as surveillance analysis, media search, and video recommendation systems.

Voyage AI and similar providers offer multimodal embeddings with **configurable dimensions** (commonly 256 to 2048). This configurability is important when storing embeddings for millions of images or video frames.

Open-source multimodal models (such as CLIP-based variants) typically output **512 or 768 dimensions**, making them efficient for on-device or edge deployments.

### Video Embeddings (Special Consideration)

Video embeddings are usually generated by:

* Extracting frames from video at fixed intervals
* Embedding each frame using an image or multimodal embedding model
* Aggregating frame embeddings (average, max pooling, or temporal attention)

Some advanced models produce a **single embedding for an entire video**, capturing both spatial and temporal information. These embeddings are usually in the range of **1024–2048 dimensions**, depending on the model.

## 2. Requirements for Building an Image/Video Chatbot Using Embeddings

Building a chatbot that understands **images, videos, and text**, and supports **streaming**, requires multiple coordinated components.

### Media Ingestion and Preprocessing

The system must accept images and video streams from users. For videos, the system needs to:

* Capture video streams in real time
* Break videos into frames or segments
* Optionally extract audio and subtitles
* Perform OCR on frames if text appears in images or video

This preprocessing step converts raw media into structured data suitable for embedding.

### Embedding Generation Layer

This layer converts different inputs into vectors:

* Text queries → text embeddings
* Images → image embeddings
* Video frames → image or multimodal embeddings

For streaming scenarios, embeddings must be generated **in near real time**, often using GPUs or specialized accelerators.

All embeddings must lie in a **compatible vector space**, especially if cross-modal search is required. Multimodal embedding models are preferred here.

### Vector Storage and Retrieval

A vector database is required to store embeddings and metadata such as:

* Frame timestamp
* Video ID
* Scene description
* Source image or document reference

This enables similarity searches like:

* “Find scenes similar to this image”
* “Show where this object appears in the video”
* “Retrieve video segments related to this question”

Efficient approximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) search is critical for real-time performance.

### Streaming and Real-Time Processing

For live image or video chatbots:

* Frames must be embedded continuously
* Embeddings must be indexed or cached instantly
* Queries must be answered using partial or evolving context

This requires:

* Streaming pipelines (event queues or message brokers)
* Asynchronous embedding generation
* Low-latency vector search

The system should support incremental updates instead of batch processing.

### LLM Integration for Conversational Intelligence

Embeddings alone retrieve relevant context; an LLM is required to:

* Interpret user intent
* Reason over retrieved text/image/video context
* Generate natural language responses

This is typically implemented using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, where:

1. User input is embedded
2. Relevant embeddings are retrieved
3. Retrieved context is passed to the LLM
4. The LLM generates a grounded response

### User Interface and Streaming UX

The chatbot interface should:

* Accept text, image, and video input
* Display answers linked to images or video timestamps
* Support live updates as video streams continue

This creates an interactive multimodal conversational experience.

## 3. Why Embedding Dimensions Matter in Video/Image Chatbots

Embedding dimensions directly affect:

* Accuracy of similarity search
* Storage requirements
* Latency during retrieval
* Cost of vector database operations

Lower dimensions are faster and cheaper but less expressive.
Higher dimensions capture richer semantics but require more compute and memory.
